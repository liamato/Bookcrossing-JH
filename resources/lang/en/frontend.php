    <h1>What is BookCrossing<span>?</span></h1>
    <p>It is the practice of leaving a book in a public place for anyone to find it, read it and then leave.</p>
    <p>Jaume Huguet school has started this project thanks to the idea of ​​BookCrossing website.</p>

    <h2>How does it work<span>?</span></h2>

    <ol>
      <li>The whole process is anonymous.</li>
      <li>Add the book on the web. When registering a book you will be given a number that you must note on the label that the school will provide and put it on the inside cover of the book.</li>
      <li>Release the book in the place you want.</li>
      <li>Take a new book that you find. The person that takes the book should notify the website that is caught entering the book code.</li>
      <li>After reading release it again wherever you want and notify it entering the code on the website.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Recommendations</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Be generous: releasing a book means giving it in the hope that someone will take it.</li>
        <li>Be hopeful: you would have access to some books that you would have never known.</li>
        <li>Don\'t be greedy: don\'t take books that you will not read immediately.</li>
        <li>Share: books should move around freely and be shared with others in a free and unselfish way.</li>
        <li>Collaborate: whenever you take a book you will make an entry in monitoring the web to let others know that this book is being read.</li>
        <li>Communicate the release of the book when you\'re done.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Thinking of Others</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>The recommended time of possession would be a month.</li>
        <li>Take care of the book so many more users would have the opportunity of reading it:
            <ul>
                <li>Enter the book in a clear plastic bag and seal it if you release it outdoors.</li>
                <li>If the book is damaged you can wrap it up.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2><span></span>Our aim<span></span></h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Promote the reading habit by the free flow of books in our school.</li>
        <li>Promote curiosity by adding personal and anonymous comments that encourage people to read the book we release.</li>
        <li>Reuse books which are kept on the shelf of oblivion.</li>
        <li>Streamline through the school web your viewpoints, experiences and recommendations among readers.</li>
